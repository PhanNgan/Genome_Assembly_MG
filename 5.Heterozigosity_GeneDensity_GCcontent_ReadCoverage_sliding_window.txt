###### I. Calculate heterozygosity in sliding genome window
# 1. Calling heterozygous SNPs between two haplomes
# 	The short reads (FASTQ) were mapped in final assembly and call for single nucleotide polymorphisms using TOGGLE
# 	The configuration file "SNPdiscoveryPaired.config.txt" was obtain at https://github.com/SouthGreenPlatform/TOGGLE/blob/master/exampleConfigs/SNPdiscoveryPaired.config.txt
# 	Following the configuration, the SNPs were called and filtered from LowQual, DP < 10 and DP > 600, QUAL < 30
		toggleGenerator.pl -d FASTQ -r $path_to_tmp/CANU_283scf.fasta  -c SNPdiscoveryPaired.config.txt -o Hiseq_canu

#	Only heterozygous SNVs were selected
		vcftools --vcf Hiseq_canu.vcf --recode --remove-indels --out Hiseq_canu_onlysnps.vcf
		grep -v "1/1" Hiseq_canu_onlysnps.vcf | grep -v "1/2" | grep -v "1/3" > Hiseq_canu_hetero_snps.vcf 
		grep "#" Hiseq_canu_onlysnps.vcf > comments
		cat comments Hiseq_canu_hetero_snps.vcf > Hiseq_canu_hetero_snps_full.vcf 

# 2.SNPs density per 10kb sliding genome window

# 	Note: sliding windows at the end of contigs (which is less than 10kb) and all contigs have length less than 10kb also were taken in consideration

		cat count_snp_10kb.txt contig_tails_and small_contig_less_than_10kb_SNP_count.txt | sort -k1r -k2g > SNP_count_total_sliding_windows.txt
#	Heterozygosity (%) in each window was calculated as: (number heterozygous SNP / window length )* 100



###### II. Calulate gene_density per sliding genome window
#	gene_density per sliding genome window
		bedops --chop 10000 --stagger 1000 -x <(awk -vOFS="\t" '{ print $1, "0", $2; }' CANU_283scf_length.bed | sort-bed -) | bedmap --echo --count --delim '\t' - <(gff2bed < genes.gff) > count_gene_10kb.txt

		cat count_gene_10kb.txt contig_tails_and small_contig_less_than_10kb_gene_count.txt | sort -k1r -k2g > gene_count_total_sliding_window.txt
#	Gene density in each window was calculated as: number of gene count / window length




###### III. calculate GC content per 1kb sliding genome window and for HGT
#	Calculate GC content per 1kb sliding window
